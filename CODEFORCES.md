# CodeForces

CodeForces is a popular competitive programming platform with regular contests and millions of registered users. Here's how you can join the competitive coding community on this website.

## Registration

Visit [codeforces.com](codeforces.com) and register using the [link on the top right](codeforces.com/register), with a personal email (university mails may not be accessible once you graduate).

## Rating

What is CodeForces rating? It's the imaginary internet points we competitive programmers spend years trying to amass! You can gain (or lose) rating by participating in contests. In order to make the contests fairer, CodeForces divides users into 4 divisions:

- Division 1 - ≥ 1900 rating
- Division 2 - < 1900 rating
- Division 3 - < 1600 rating
- Division 4 - < 1400 rating

The difficulty follows the same pattern - Div. 4 contests tend to have the easiest problems, while Div.1 contests are the hardest.

As you've probably noticed, many of the divisions overlap. In such cases, you can participate in contest from any of the divisions you qualify for. When getting started, we'd recommend going for Div. 4 and Div. 3 contests.

## Registering for contests

On CodeForces, problems are organised into timed _contests_. To register for a contest, you have to open the contests tab and register **prior to the contest timing.** Keep in mind that though some contests allow late registration, starting a contest significantly late will lead to a score reduction.

## Solving contests

Each contest generally lasts for 2-3 hours and has 6-8 problems of varying difficulty. Usually, the problems are in order of increasing difficulty. They are generally of two types:

1. ICPC style:
    - In this type of contest, every problem has the same value. Contestants are ranked baseed on their _number of problems solved_. Ties are broken by the total time penalty.
    - **Time penalty** is a number calculated by adding up the time since the start of the contest till you solved each of the problems. Unsolved problems do not add to your time penalty.
2. CodeForces Style:
    - In this type of contest, every problem has a different score assigned to it. Contestants are ranked _purely on score basis._
    - The point value of every question decays over time, such that solving a problem at the end of the contest awards you far less points than solving it at the start.

In both types of contests, it is strongly recommended to start with the easiest questions first, as they award you points quickly with little time investment.

### Submitting solutions

When you open a problem's page, there is a section on the sidebar to the right that allows you to select your language and upload your program. If you're submitting a C++ file, select ```GNU G++ 20```. If you're submitting in Python, select ```PyPy 3.9.10```. If the section does not appear, check whether you're logged in.

## Practicing problems

On the CodeForces toolbar, you'll find a tab called [problemset.](codeforces.com/problemset) It contains all the problems from all the public contests since CodeForces was founded.

At the top of the table, the lightning icon signifies the difficulty rating of the problem. It is a rough estimate of how difficult the problemsetters considered it to be, going from 800-3500. The checkmark icon signifies how many people have successfully submitted solutions to the problem. You can sort the problems by clicking on these headings.

Problems are tagged with the concepts they involve. You can filter by a tag if you want more practice with the corresponding topic.

When getting started, try solving the 800 rated problems to get familiar with the input/output and submission mechanics of CodeForces. Which brings us to...
