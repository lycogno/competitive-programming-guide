# Language

The first question most people ask when getting started is - what language do I use? The answer, as always, is "it depends." That said, you will find the most flexibility and speed when using C++. Running time is critical in competitive programming. Also, I like C++, so I'll be using it throughout the rest of this tutorial.

Feel free to follow along using Python or Java. Setup is quite straightforward - you can install [Eclipse for Java](https://eclipseide.org) or [Python](https://www.python.org) + the VS Code extension and [skip straight to coding](PROGRAMMING.md). But be aware that you may hit time or memory limits on some of the harder problems and have to switch languages (especially Python).

# Operating system

One of the first things you have to consider as a competitive programmer is your operating system (OS). Most of you may have been using Windows on your devices so far. However, if possible, I would recommend you install [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com), or another Linux distribution. Many developer and competitive programming tools are easier to set up and more reliable on Linux. 

That said, a lot of these issues have been fixed in recent Windows updates, so take the above with a grain of salt.

As for MacOS users, while most tools work great out of the box, you might have to hack together a solution for those that don't. Be prepared.

# Installing C++

If you're on Linux, you can skip this. A C++ compiler (g++) comes preinstalled.

If you're on MacOS, the easiest method is to download and install [homebrew](https://brew.sh). Then, type ```brew install gcc``` into your terminal to perform the install.

## Windows

If you've decided to stick with Windows despite reading my blatant Linux propaganda, you'll need to install a C++ compiler/runtime. Windows does not provide you with one by default, and VS Code only installs autofill and highlighting tools. Your best option, ~~apart from switching to Linux~~, is to install [minGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org). It contains almost everything you need to get C++ running on Windows. [This GFG article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installing-mingw-tools-for-c-c-and-changing-environment-variable/) provides a good guide to setting things up. If you prefer a video format, [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/j8nAHeVKL08?t=645) (in Hindi) will walk you through the process.

## Windows Method 2: WLS + VSCode (Recommended) 
- Download WSL using this guide [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install]
- Download VSCode using this guide [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows]
- In the bottom left corner of VSCode, you will find a button that says "Open a Remote Window". Click on it and select "Open WSL Window"
- You will now be in a Linux environment. You can install g++ using the command ```sudo apt install g++```
- You can now start coding in C++ using VSCode in a Linux environment.

## The other option - online compilers

While not recommended (since testing gets messy quickly), you can use an online C++ compiler while you're procrastinating on your minGW install. You can find plenty of these with a simple [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?rls=en&q=online+c%2B%2B+compiler&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), so I won't link any.

# Code editor

VS Code.

As simple as that. [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) from Microsoft's official website. It is a full-featured and versatile option, both for those new to programming and those with experience. If you already have an editor that works with C++, you can keep using it; no issues.

[The C++ extension]() is, of course, a must. [Here are setup instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) for using it with minGW.

VS Code also comes with an [in-built terminal.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics)


# Good to go!

Congratulations! If you've reached this point, this means you're done with setup! You can now get started with building the [programming](PROGRAMMING.md) skills that are a competitive programmer's bread and butter.
