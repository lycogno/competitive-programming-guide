# Welcome!

If you're here, that means you've decided to dip your toes into the fascinating world of competitive programming (CP). Have some ideas, but unsure how to get started? Take a seat and [dive right into these competitive resources!](SETUP.md)

## Who this repo is for

Most of these resources are targeted towards beginners who have done little to no competitive programming before (<1000 rating, or no CodeForces account). If you've already done some CP before, perhaps participated in your nation's qualifiers for the INOI, feel free to skip straight to the [advanced resources section](ADVANCED.md). But if all of that sounded like Greek to you, you're in the right place! [These resources will familiarise you](SETUP.md) with some of the tools and techniques commonly used in CP. I hope you'll be part of the competitive programming community for years to come.
